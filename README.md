# E-E-BOOK-RECCOMMENDER-MODEL

### Project Overview 
In the following project we will be implementing and end to end project where we willl be scrapping data from AMAZON WEBSITE specifically we will be scrapping books and after scrapping this data we will have to clean this data after cleaning this data   we will load this data to a database and 
query our data using SQL after querying our data we will get tables and after getting tables we will load thsese tables to TABLEAU  and visualize the data.After visualizing this data we will then preprocess the data and  create a book reccommender model  so the outline of our project is as follows:
1. scrapping the data using PYTHON FROM AMAZON WEBSITE

2. Cleaning our data

3. Perfoming an EDA

4.  Loading the data to SQL and querying to form tables

5.  Loading the queried tables to TABLEAU  and forming vizualizations

6.  Preprocessing the data and creating  a book reccommender model

    The process of scrapping the data from the amazon website i have done it clearly and explained bit by bit and even on ways to read the HTML tags and extracting the data to the process of forming a csv file , I have clearly outlined the steps in the below article.You can give it a like  and a clap

 Thus in this Readme file we will be covering the DATA CLEANING AND EDA part ,The EDA may not be a s detailed since we will also have the SQL QUERIES  TABLEAU visualizations  to gain further insights
